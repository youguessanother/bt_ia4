# Smart Contract Exploits Threat Model

## Threat Description
Smart contract exploits arise from flaws in business logic, unsafe input handling, or misconfigured access control. Attackers attempt to manipulate functions, bypass authorization, or cause unintended ledger updates.

## Assets at Risk
- Chaincode logic integrity
- Product tracking workflow
- Ledger state correctness

## Attack Vectors
- Passing malformed or extreme inputs
- Bypassing role checks to perform unauthorized transfers
- Exploiting inconsistent validation or missing state checks
- Triggering unexpected states to corrupt product lifecycle records

## Preconditions
- Insufficient validation of input parameters
- Lack of code audits and automated analysis
- Overly permissive ACLs or endorsement rules

## Impact
- Unauthorized product transfers
- Tampered or lost history records
- Compromised supply-chain traceability
- Disruption of enterprise operations

## Mitigations
- Comprehensive code audits and unit testing
- Formal verification for high-impact logic
- Strict access control and MSP-based authorization
- Input validation and defensive programming
- Event logging and anomaly monitoring
