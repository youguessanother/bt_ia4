# Consensus Improvements

## Purpose
Strengthen reliability and security of the network against manipulation or faults.

## Recommendations
- Use permissioned consensus for deterministic finality.
- Define endorsement policies requiring multiple organizations.
- Validate transaction payloads early to reduce faulty commits.
- Deploy peers across isolated infrastructure for fault tolerance.
- Rotate certificates regularly and maintain revocation mechanisms.
- Maintain reconciliation procedures to detect unexpected state divergence.
